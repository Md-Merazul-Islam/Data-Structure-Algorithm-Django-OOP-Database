Complexity-related InterView  MCQ or Question

1.What is time complexity ?
Ans: The complexity is a way to describe the efficiency of an algorithm to determine how itâ€™s execution time grows reliably the input size . It depends on the size of input. Time complexity can be categorized into:
1. Best case 		 O(1)
2. Average case 	O(log n)
3. Worst case 		O(N)


2.Why do we use time complexity?
Ans: We use time complexity to undustant how efficiently algorithms perform as the input size grows. It helps us compare algorithms , predict performance, and choose the best one for solving problems efficiently.

Ans : Space complexity is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of the input. It helps us understand how the memory requirements of an algorithm grow as the input size increases . Space complexity is often expressed using Big-O notation 
O(1) - constant space - memory usage does not change with input size.
O(n) - Linear space - memory usage grows linearly with input size.
O(n^2) Quadratic space  - memory usage grows proportionally to the square of the input size.

Stack and Queue-related interview  MCQ or Question (with Answer)


1. What is stack? What approche follows to complete this operation ?
Ans : A stack is a data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates: you add new plates to the top and remove plates from the top.

2.  What is the queue? What approche follows to complete this operation ?
Ans: A queue is a data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. Imagine a queue in a supermarket: the person who arrives first is the first to be served.






3. What is the key operation of the stack ? 
Ans : 
Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Remove the element from the top of the stack.
Top: Retrieve the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
IsEmpty: Check if the stack is empty.


4. What is the key operation of the queue?
Ans: 
Enqueue: Add an element to the end of the queue.
Dequeue: Remove the element from the front of the queue.
Front/Peek: Retrieve the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
IsEmpty: Check if the queue is empty.
5. What is the time complexity of pushing an element onto the stack?
i) O(1)
ii) O(n)
iii) O(log n)
iv) O(n log n)
Answer: i) O(1)

Answer: ii) Underflow

11. How do you implement a stack that supports finding the minimum element in constant time?
class MinStack
{
private:
    stack<int> s;
    stack<int> minStack;


public:
    void push(int x)
    {
        s.push(x);
        if (minStack.empty() || x <= minStack.top())
            minStack.push(x);
    }
    void pop()
    {
        if (s.top() == minStack.top())
            minStack.pop();
        s.pop();
    }
    int getMin()
    {
        if (minStack.empty())
            return -1;
        return minStack.top();
    }
};





12. Write a function to reverse the first k elements of a queue.
Ans: 
void reverseKElements(queue<int> &q, int k)
{
    if (q.empty() || k > q.size())
        return;
    stack<int> s;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++)
    {
        s.push(q.front());
        q.pop();
    }
    while (!s.empty())
    {
        q.push(s.top());
        s.pop();
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < q.size() - k; i++)
    {
        q.push(q.front());
        q.pop();
    }
}




13. How would you implement a stack using arrays?
Ans : A stack using an array where the top element is at the last position. The push() operation adds elements at the end, and pop() removes elements from the end.
14. What is the difference between a stack and a queue?
Ans  : Stack follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle, whereas a queue follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle. 

15. What is a priority queue?
ANS: A priority queue is a special type of queue where each element has a priority assigned to it. The element with the highest priority is dequeued before elements with lower priority, regardless of their insertion order.


When is Binary Search appropriate to use?

Ans : An already-sorted list can be searched using the Binary Search algorithm in the data structure. The algorithm uses the divide-and-conquer strategy.2.

Which data structure is used to perform recursion?

Ans: Stack data structure is used in recursion due to its last in first out nature. Operating system maintains the stack in order to save the iteration variables at each function call

Can binary search be implemented recursively?
Yes, binary search can be implemented both iteratively and recursively. The recursive implementation often leads to more concise code but may have slightly higher overhead due to recursive stack space or function calls.

 What is the time complexity of Binary Search?
The time complexity of binary search is O(log2n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because the size of the search interval is halved in each step.
